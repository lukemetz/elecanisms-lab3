Mechanical
- CAD motor housing, haptic interface
- Manufacture and assemble parts

Electrical
- Characterize motor (Stall Torque, free spinning frequency)
- Determine Ke, Kt (remember, T = Ke * i, w / Kt = V ... or something)
- Use minor feedback loops to ensure proper voltage/current control (?)

Firmware
- Read encoder, determine speed and position
- Receive command from computer
- Write voltage for motor control
- (Poll for new value every now and then? Currently, it's all interrupt driven from the UI side...)

Software
- Get and set values from firmware. 
- Use position to make a "spring"
- GUI to set k and B
